JobTo is a suite of applications for managing tickets and services for remote support companies.

With it your customer will be able to open calls directly on the screen of his cell phone, and all this using its own structure having more security and reliability in the data.

We use PostgreSQL database for the API server for being open-source and SQLite3 for configurations. All data is encrypted before being sent via API and can only be decrypted using the master key.
